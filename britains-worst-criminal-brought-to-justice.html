    <p>Thames Valley Police put yet another feather in its cap after arresting a woman accused of 50 separate crimes shortly after brunch this&nbsp;morning.</p>
<p>Anne Sheep, from Milton Keynes, was first reported to have been in charge of caring for her child without the appropriate Childcare Licence. Ofsted says looking after children this way without being registered and licenced contravenes the Nanny Act as the care lasted for longer than two hours and constituted receiving &#8220;a&nbsp;reward&#8221;.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>A neighbour reported Ms. Sheep saying she found raising her son &#8216;very rewarding&#8217; so this is in clear violation of the measures we put in place to protect children from their mothers,&#8221; an Ofsted inspector wrote on his Myspace&nbsp;blog.</p>
<p>Civil Liberties campaigners and other whingers were said to be outraged at the incident and have responded in full force by drawing Hitler moustaches on photographs of the Minister for Children, Roger&nbsp;Duck.</p>
<h2>Livid</h2>
<p>In an interview over Facebook chat, Ms. Sheep told <span class="caps">WAFTI</span>: &#8220;When the inspector called, the first thing she did was wipe her feet. Then she distracted me with a card trick while another officer handcuffed&nbsp;me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was then taken to the police station and only allowed one phone call and to be able to check Facebook for 10 minutes, whilst her child was taken into&nbsp;protection.</p>
