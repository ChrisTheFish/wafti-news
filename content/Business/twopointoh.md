title: John Lewis Decimates Business Landscape With "2.0" Bombshell

The John Lewis Partnership today announced plans to revolutionise retail by
updating the business model of their 27 department stores across the UK to
catch up to the Internet age.
</p>

<p>
As of the 31st of August, the stores will distribute their products for free, 
while advertising will be the sole income for the stores. The goods 
themselves will act as loss leaders to entice the consumer to the store. 
Advertisments will be placed on walls, floors and the soon to be erected 
stands decicated to displaying both static and video adverts. Approximately
70% of existing shop floor space will be converted to advert space to 
increase the ratio of income generating floorspace to attraction only floorspace.

The move is stunning, but not without precedent. The burgeoning success of 
"Web 2.0" strategies as successfully employed by such trend-setters as Facebook 
and Twitter has caused many business experts to predict its appearance in
the more traditional world of bricks-and-mortar stores. 
</p>
<p>
Facebook was valued at approximately $15bn dollars when they raised capital 
by selling stock to Microsoft; Twitter's value was said to be $500m when 
Facebook attempted to buy them with an offer of that value of Facebook stock
in a move that many now discredited experts would have described as trading 
clouds only two decades ago. Both have done so by concentrating on finding 
audience for adverts rather than the clearly defunct approach of having a product 
that customers are willing to pay for.
</p>
<p>
"We have to move with the times," said Bertram Yardy, the manager of the 
Newcastle branch. "These days success isn't about profits or sustainability. 
The number of customers you attract defines your worth as a business and we 
want to tap into that."
</p>
<p>
What sort of adverts will be displayed? "The plan is to have a better quality
of advert as well as a greater number. For example, we have one - you'll love
this - where you have to try to swat the fly. If you do, you can win prizes! I
think it'll really add to the experience of shopping in a John Lewis store
and will certainly augment the product we have in a way that we just couldn't
do before with sales staff and tasteful presentation," Yardy said.
</p>

The partnership aims to have more than tripled the number of customers coming 
into their stores by 2011. While the revenue from advertsing will be unimportantly 
less than that of selling products, Yardy feels that a smaller profit from a larger
number of people is an acheivable goal. "Free is such an enticing concept, and 
getting something for free will make people want to spend money on the products
we're advertsing," he explained.
