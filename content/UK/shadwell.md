<p>
The blackened, sooty streets of Shadwell<br>
Glowed in ochre, dingy dark<br>
and twisted, inky shades were formed<br>
with Lucifer's heretic mark...<br>
</p>

<!--BREAK-->

<p>
Inert and silent stillness rested,<br>
Draped across the dampened ground<br>
And flitting, dancing figures flew<br>
Above me, all without a sound.<br>
</p>

<p>
A distant light came intermittent<br>
Struggling through the misty rain<br>
A traveller, a hardy fool<br>
Who'd ventured far from his domain.<br>
</p>

<p>
Approaching ever louder, brighter<br>
Bearing down with startling force<br>
And suddenly they fade away.<br>
I turn and leave the beaten course;<br>
</p>

<p>
Amongst the dripping filth and moistness<br>
Hid by arches in the gloom <br>
I met a man whose life was done<br>
To listen to his tale of doom.<br>
</p>

<p>
'You're late!' he spat. 'The midnight's past.<br>
Now, listen to my tale of doom.<br>
Your Auntie Enid's on to me<br>
'bout doing up the old spare room.'<br>
</p>

<p>
I seek a place, quite near to here;<br>
a vending place, for paint and paste.<br>
For DIY, in other words,<br>
Where I may rush with hen-pecked haste.<br>
</p>

<p>
I summoned you, oh nephew dear<br>
because you know this idle place<br>
and may, perchance, assist me in<br>
my half-arsed aim to save my face.<br>
</p>

<p>
'Oh, do you know of such a shop?'<br>
he cried. 'Why yes,' I reassured.<br>
'I came upon it last week gone<br>
while I was wand'ring, deathly bored<br>
</p>

<p>
and waiting for the match to start - 'twas<br>
Ajax versus Feyenoord.<br>
And lo, there was I, visilin<br>
the subject of your previous words,<br>
</p>

<p>
A merchant's house without compare,<br>
A smorgasbord of DIY,<br>
where any home-improvement scheme<br>
is possible!' I hoarsly cried.<br>
</p>

<p>
'Oh, joy!' he yelled. 'It must reveal<br>
Its manifold delights to me!'<br>
I briefly thought to tease him but<br>
he touched me with his abject plea.<br>
</p>

<p>
'The place you seek is very near.<br>
You take a right, then left, and then<br>
you pass the demon traffic lights<br>
which are not fit for God nor men<br>
</p>

<p>
and then proceed to yonder street.<br>
And there, Valhalla you will mark.<br>
'You king of men!' he thanked me, and<br>
we parted in the dingy dark.<br>
</p>
