Music pundits and the listening public alike were feeling fine today as Apple Corp announced the discovery of hundreds of Beatles songs in 
the upper reaches of the Top 40. However, experts have expressed doubts as to their authenticity.

The initial announcement of the discovery was made by James Female, a hardback writer and part-time Conservative councillor from Upminster. 'I've 
been an admirer of The Rolling Beatles for as long as I can remember,' he told WAFTI. 'I happened to be sitting at home browsing the interweb when I 
accidentally typed in the wrong website navigation code and found myself looking at the front screen of something called Amazon. And there I saw 
listed this huge box of rock and roll song-cycles by Ringo and the rest. I couldn't believe it, quite frankly, so I quickly pinged off an e-letter to 
Apple Corp and within minutes it was all over the RSSSSS feeds.'

The Beatles were thought to be a band, invented in the early 1960s, although little else is known of their career and work. Folklorists' writings and 
vagrants' tales form much of the small amount of information available. Songs generally accepted to have been written by them include the far-sighted 
animal rights anthem 'I Am The Walrus' and the wedding party favourite 'Hey, Bulldog'. They are speculated, however, to have produced more than two 
songs; indeed, experts have said that one in every 8 people may have heard one at some point in their lives.

It is understood that the find, thought to be the first find of its kind, contains most of the Beatles' back catalogue, but musicologists 
speculate that they may not, in fact, be authentic original recordings. 'My colleagues and I have been studying these records since they were first 
brought to our attention,' said Dr Adrian Bong, of the London College of Music and a world expert on music. 'The mood at first was electric. We tried 
to act naturally, but, whatever. However, after a more analytical approach ensued, we realised that what we were hearing could not be authentic.'

Dr Bong theorises that the recordings may have been tampered with by some form of electronic agent, prior to being transferred onto separate media 
and sold on to the public. 'Although we have absolutely no way of knowing this for certain, we feel sure that the waveforms have been digitally 
tweaked, fixing holes, if you will,' said Dr Bong, 'and hence, what can be heard on these discs is perhaps not identical to what the group originally 
laid onto tape. This, of course, does not affect in any way the sheer apathy of a large cross-section of the music-listening public to this find.'

It is not known how long the collection will remain within the top 40, but the Met Office has speculated that a new girl band is showing signs of 
forming somewhere in the Southeast of the country within the next decade or so, which may have a significant impact on the masters' placing within 
the 
hit parade.

WAFTI has not been able to investigate, verify or establish via hear'say any of the information previously stated in this article, but the board  
of directors of WAFTI's parent organisation, HP Bulmer Ltd, is adamant that it's all true.
