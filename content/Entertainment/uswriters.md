While desperately searching for the next question,
writer Paul O'Paulsky stumbled upon an answer. This 
weekend viewers of Ambigous Situation will find 
themselves in a slightly reduced state of bewilderment 
after they see the newest episode.

"I guess it had to happen eventually," O'Paulsky said in
a packed press conference. "We had so many loose ends
flying around that when trying to write a new one, I 
accidentally wrote in some continuity."

Network chief Milkit Ahlot played down the incident.
"This doesn't diminish our ability to string out the 
show much longer than necessary. We will still be able
to bleed its originality dry before we have to cancel.
We aren't in danger of doing a 'Battlestar Galactica' and
plugging the plot holes. Shareholders have nothing to
worry about."

It remains to be seen whether or not the viewing public
will stand for such shenanigans however. Unwelcome and
unexpected elements of shows, such as referencing past
events, have been known to upset the audience. Ambiguous 
Situation and especially lead characted Captain Standard
will need to get back to their hard-hitting mundanity sooner 
rather than later or their 24th season could be their last.
