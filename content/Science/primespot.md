title: Prostitutes More Smarter Than Previously Thought

<p>A group of some scientists have revealed that prostitutes have a 
sophisticated grasp of mathematics, including the discovery of concepts 
hitherto unknown to mainstream research.</p>
<!--BREAK-->
<p>Research carried out by psychoscientists at Brixton University has 
demonstrated that prostitutes only ever congregate on street corners in 
prime numbers. Prior to this, it had long been assumed that prostitutes 
employed basic dynamic processes as an evolutionary consequence of 
dealing with drunken customers. Prof. Abject Poverty of the University's 
department said 'Hookers were always thought to have evolved to tout for 
business according to the logistic equation of population growth, and 
were therefore limited by the natural resources that a stretch of 
pavement could provide. However, these results suggest that some new, 
hidden, factors could be determining their distribution'.</p>
<p>Prof. Poverty and his colleagues have been able to show that the 
random walk process, when applied to slags, is intrinsically flawed, as 
they are subject to a previously unknown factor termed 'insubordinate 
dependence'. This effect causes the women to be financially attracted 
towards supplies of narcotics, which distorts the mathematical things of 
the random walk theory. Prof. Poverty's team has observed that a 
superposition of prostitutes' attractors bears similarities to the 
distribution of prime numbers, and may eventually lead to a more 
thorough understanding of non-integer-dimensional surfaces. 
<p>The results have aroused controversy in the scientific community, 
however. Dr Brian Awsh of UCL said 'the whole thrust of their argument 
is likely wrong. Their sample size of 412 prostitutes in the Milton Road 
area of Cambridge is far too small to be representative of the 
neighbourhood as a whole', while his colleague Dr James Ypres added 
'Look at my face.' However, Laris Hilson, of the Collectors' Guild of 
Prostitutes, said 'This research may yield some interesting insights for 
the analysts of the sex industry. The idea that prostitutes could 
influence the proof of the Riemann hypothesis is not a new one, but a 
public vindication of their relevance in this field is long overdue.</p>
<p>There is some way to go before the ladies of the night are able to 
provide any relevant research data. However, the identification of two 
previously unrelated branches of science has many researchers excited. 
'Who knows what this could lead to?' asked Prof. Poverty, questioningly. 
'There is new research being undertaken on infinite series of 
prostitutes that should hopefully be able to provide further insight 
into what, I think, is a very attractive young area.'<P>
