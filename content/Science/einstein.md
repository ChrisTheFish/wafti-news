<p>
The Metropolitan Police today called for the Moon to be removed from existence after numerous working problems were experienced by their forces.

Coleman Balls, the Deputy Assistant Commissioner, called on
theorists to reconsider the position and effectiveness of the Moon,
as it was proving a threat to effective policing in the
London area.
</p>
<p>
Mr Balls explained, 'The Moon is proving particularly
counterproductive to the safe policing of the capital's
streets, especially in conjunction with the Theory of
Special Relativity. As it is obvious that this theory
has withstood experimental test and cannot be reworked,
it has to be that the Moon must go.'
</p>

Asked by our correspondent to explain his position,
Commissioner Balls continued 'Einstein's theory
postulates that photons of light have momentum,
and that some of this momentum is imparted to an
object when they interact with it. At night, the
Moon pours photons down onto the criminals on the
streets, supplying them with extra momentum and
giving them the ability to outrun our dedicated
team of patrol officers.' When asked to comment 
on why his officers did not feel the same benefits
of this effect as the criminals, he pointed out that
'criminals are usually black. I mean, wear black.
Dark substances act as black bodies and absorb more
radiation, and therefore the effect is more pronounced
on these scoundrels.'
</p>
<p>
The Commissioner's idea would have important ramifications
if it was accepted by scientists. Without the Moon's
presence, the tides would fail, destroying sea life,
and the seasons would cease to meaningfully exist, and
the Earth may possibly spiral in towards the Sun,
causing certain death for all Londoners.
</p>
<p>
The Home Office, when contacted, could not return our
calls. However, Commissioner Balls' idea is sure to be
discussed at next week's Meeting of Scientists in
Cheshire.
